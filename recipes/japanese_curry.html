        <h2>Dish Description</h2>
        <p>Japanese curry is typically made from a paste or bouillon block. Vegetables such as potatoes, carrots and onions
        are paired with a meat like chicken. The vegetables are boiled in water until cooked and then the meat and curry
        blocks are added. The mixture is then stirred until the curry block dissolves and thickens. Japanese curry is
        typically eaten with rice and is very delicious</p>
